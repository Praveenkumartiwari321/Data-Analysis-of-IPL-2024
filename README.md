## Introduction

The IPL 2024 Data Analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of players and teams during the IPL 2024 season. By analyzing data on the highest wicket-takers (Purple Cap), highest run-scorers (Orange Cap), team standings, and the eventual winner, we can derive meaningful patterns and trends.

## Installation

To run the analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ipl-2024-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ipl-2024-analysis
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
